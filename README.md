1. Write a function that takes a string argument and returns the fifth element of the string, if the string is long enough, 
and returns None if the string has fewer than five elements.

2. Write a function that takes a string argument and returns the string reversed.

3. Write a function that takes a string and prints out a list of the ASCII/UTF-8 codes for each of the characters in the 
string. Use can use the ord function.


Bonus: Expanding on 3, use the ASCII code for the character to decide whether it is upper case or lower case, and change it 
to the other case.
